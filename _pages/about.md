<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Ruiqi Chen, I will join the [Human Centered Design & Engineering](https://www.hcde.washington.edu/) program at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) as a graduate student in Fall 2024. Previously, I received my dual Bachelor's degree in Data Science from Duke University and Duke Kunshan University in May 2024.

My research interests lie primarily at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction(HCI) and Artificial Intelligence(AI), combining human and machine intelligence to create interactive systems for accessibility, collaboration, and beyond. In my past three years of research experience, my research scope has included Human-Centered AI, Human-AI Collaboration, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Extended Reality (XR), and Virtual Reality (VR).
